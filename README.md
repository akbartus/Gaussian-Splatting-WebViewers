<img alt="Screenshot" src="img/screenshot.jpg" width="600">

### **Description / Rationale**
This is an experimental project demonstrating various implementations of Gaussian Splatting (a real-time renderer for <a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</a>) viewers for the web, which are powered by Three.js. In particular, first gaussian splatting viewer was written based on example created by Quadr for <a href="https://github.com/quadjr/aframe-gaussian-splatting/tree/main">A-Frame as component</a>. The second viewer is the simplified and without any dependencies minimal version of Mark Kellog's <a href="https://github.com/mkkellogg/GaussianSplats3D">GaussianSplats3D Three.js example</a>. Both repositories, in turn, used  used Kevin Kwok's <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/splat">WebGL implementation of Gaussian Splatting</a>.    

### **Instructions**
To use the viewer locally copy either "gaussian_splatting_1" or "gaussian_splatting_2" folder to your local server. 

### **Tech Stack**
The project is powered by AFrame and Three.js
